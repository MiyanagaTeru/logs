issues: 
	- step 9. when grunt serve:dist, the browser returns 
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED  http://localhost:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1
    But it's ok to do grunt serve only. need investigation.    



solved issues:

-A: open bower.json, change       "bootstrap": "^3.2.0" to  "bootstrap": "3.3.4" . run  bower install again to get new bootstrap.
	the reason is bootstrap 3.3.5 doesn't work. refer http://stackoverflow.com/a/30953464/5277542
